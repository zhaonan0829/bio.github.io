        Hi

        My name is zhao nan.

        I am an interaction designer and have been engaged in design, development and system analysis for 9 years. I'm now working in <a href="https://en.winsing.net" class="a1" target="_blank">WinSing</a>, we are building a creative project management and collaboration platform for the film and television and animation production industry, which provides a unified tool set for the production process and review collaboration of film assets and shots. Its vision is to combine the collaboration and management of film and television projects, and ultimately help customers achieve market success. Although the platform is very complex and huge, it also generates many design opportunities. In the past two years, we have successively designed <i>Sequence review</i> for film and television review, task file management system <i>IN File system</i>, <i>KanBan system</i> for task visualization, and <i>Assets Library</i> for asset management, which have brought new challenges and progress to the design team.

        Before that, I had the honor to join NetEase and provide a series of operational conceptual designs for the team. I also worked in the <a href="http://guzhenstory.com" class="a1" target="_blank">Guzhen story workshop</a>, where I designed a series of auxiliary tools for text researchers to help them objectively understand text features from the dimensions of text structure, human and material emotions, complex rhythm, etc. in a short time.

        In 2015, I participated in the design and technical support of the core product <a href="https://www.deepmind.cn/?page_id=20811" class="a1" target="_blank">TFlow</a> at the early stage of the <a href="https://www.deepmind.cn" class="a1" target="_blank">DMS</a> Team. TFlow can easily integrate the world's advanced printing processes into traditional printing plants, greatly improving the energy efficiency of printing plants and reducing resource consumption. I also joined the China Mobile <a href="https://open.iot.10086.cn" class="a1" target="_blank">IOT cloud</a> product team, accumulating the demands and feedbacks of users in many provinces and cities through research and interviews, and providing basis support for the design of the final portal.

        Design expertise and accumulation in film  production, games, telecommunications, printing, retail and other fields, ultimately providing users with excellent product experience. I draw inspiration from reading, traveling and meeting new friends. I also like to find intoxicating Chinese tea while traveling long distances.
