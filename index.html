        I am an interaction designer and have been engaged in design, development and system analysis for 9 years. I'm now working in <a href="https://matters-lab.io" class="a1" target="_blank">Matters</a>, Matters Lab is building a Web3 social media ecosystem that lets users collaboratively create and monetize digital assets with complete control.

        Before that, I had the honor to join <a href="http://game.163.com" class="a1" target="_blank">NetEase</a> and provide a series of operational conceptual designs for the team. I also worked in the <a href="http://guzhenstory.com" class="a1" target="_blank">Guzhen story workshop</a>, where I designed a series of auxiliary tools for text researchers to help them objectively understand text features from the dimensions of text structure, human and material emotions, complex rhythm, etc. in a short time.

        In 2015, I participated in the design and technical support of the core product <a href="https://www.deepmind.cn/?page_id=20811" class="a1" target="_blank">TFlow</a> at the early stage of the <a href="https://www.deepmind.cn" class="a1" target="_blank">DMS</a> Team. TFlow can easily integrate the world's advanced printing processes into traditional printing plants, greatly improving the energy efficiency of printing plants and reducing resource consumption. I also joined the China Mobile <a href="https://open.iot.10086.cn" class="a1" target="_blank">IOT cloud</a> product team, accumulating the demands and feedbacks of users in many provinces and cities through research and interviews, and providing basis support for the design of the final portal.

        Design expertise and accumulation in film  production, games, telecommunications, printing, retail and other fields, ultimately providing users with excellent product experience. I draw inspiration from reading, traveling and meeting new friends. I also like to find intoxicating Chinese tea while traveling long distances.
