        Hi 
        <span style="color: #CCCCCC; font-weight: 300">/</span>

        I am an interaction designer and have been engaged in design, development and system analysis for seven years. At present, I am working in <a href="http://guzhenstory.com" class="a1" target="_blank">Guzhen story workshop</a>(walked off). We mainly provide a series of auxiliary tools for text researchers to help them understand the text features objectively in a short time from the dimensions of text structure, character emotions, complex beats, etc. I like what we are doing now.

        In 2015, I participated in the design and technical support of the core product <a href="https://www.deepmind.cn/?page_id=20811" class="a1" target="_blank">TFlow</a> at the early stage of the <a href="https://www.deepmind.cn" class="a1" target="_blank">DMS</a> Team. TFlow can easily integrate the world's advanced printing processes into traditional printing plants, greatly improving the energy efficiency of printing plants and reducing resource consumption. I also joined the China Mobile <a href="https://open.iot.10086.cn" class="a1" target="_blank">IOT cloud</a> product team, accumulating the demands and feedbacks of users in many provinces and cities through research and interviews, and providing basis support for the design of the final portal.

        Design expertise and accumulation in IT, Telecom, Printing and Typesetting, Retail and other fields, and ultimately provide users with excellent product use experience. I draw inspiration from reading, traveling and meeting new friends. I also like to find intoxicating Chinese tea while traveling long distances.
